# Password-Generator-
SHOULD NOT BE USED - EXTENAL FILE NOT SECURE AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE 
MEMORY CONSUMING AS LIST GROWS - NOT EFFICIENT FILE SEARCHING
IDEA - https://www.101computing.net/random-password-generator/

Generate a password at random, will add generated password to external file and check the generated password isnt already in file so no duplicates are generated
